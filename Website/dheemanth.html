        <p>During last years season, Dheemanth essentially traded the best reciver in the league for a sack of potatoes for the sole reason that he wanted to "spice up the action because nobody was doing anything", and he gave up Antinio Brown for Adam Theilen. Ben already had a positive record at this point and this set him farther ahead. Dheemanth lost the trade by large propotions, as he fell from 7-2 to 7-5 and missed playoffs. </p>
